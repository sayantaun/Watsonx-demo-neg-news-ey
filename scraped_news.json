He is also facing\u00a0 arson and burglary charges and is being held in lieu of $150,00 bail, the Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department said.\n\nCarl James Dial Jr., 23, is shown in this booking photo provided by the Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department in Indio, California December 12, 2015.

No one was injured, the police said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reprehensible and the people who perpetrated that act should be treated the way we would any other terrorist,\u201d John Benoit, the Riverside County Supervisor, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News Dial\u2019s father said he thought his son was attending a college class when he witnessed him carrying backpack on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe was caught up in social media,\u201d Dials father said. \u201cSocial media has produced people like my son, without person-to-person contact. I believe he was lacking in social skills.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the same mosque was hit by bullets though no one was charged for the incident.\n\nLeft:\n                A view of damage at the burned Islamic Society of Coachella Valley on Saturday.

Prosecutors had previously also charged him with murder as a hate crime. Jackson\u2019s attorney had no comment.\n\nWhite veteran 'regarded fatal stabbing of black man as practice for larger attack'Read more\n\nJackson is accused of killing Timothy Caughman, 66, a stranger to him. Caughman was attacked from behind last week as he was collecting bottles for recycling.\n\nAn arraignment on the indictment has been set for 13 April.\n\nSpeaking with a reporter for the Daily News at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, Jackson said he had intended it as \u201ca practice run\u201d in a mission to deter interracial relationships.\n\nHe said he envisioned a white woman thinking: \u201cWell, if that guy feels so strongly about it, maybe I shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nCaughman, who was remembered as a gentleman and a good neighbor, was alone when he was attacked from behind with a sword. He staggered, bleeding, into a police station and later died at a hospital.\n\n\u201cTim Caughman did not deserve to die like that,\u201d said Portia Clark, a childhood friend who grew up in Queens and attended the hearing with Caughman\u2019s other friends on Monday. \u201cNobody does. I mean, come on, we\u2019re black, white, yellow, brown \u2013 that\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019re trying to get along.\u201d\n\nCarl Nimmons wept outside court after seeing Jackson. \u201cIt really hurt me to see that man, because I can\u2019t do nothing about it. I don\u2019t have the power to do anything about it,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the Rikers interview, Jackson said in retrospect that he would rather have killed \u201ca young thug\u201d or \u201ca successful older black man with blondes ... people you see in Midtown. These younger guys that put white girls on the wrong path\u201d.\n\nHe complained that on television, \u201cit\u2019s like every other commercial in the past few years has a mixed-race couple in it\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe white race is being eroded ... No one cares about you. The Chinese don\u2019t care about you, the blacks don\u2019t care about you,\u201d he said.\n\nJackson, who was raised in what was described as a churchgoing, liberal family in a Baltimore suburb, said his ideal society was \u201c1950s America\u201d.\n\nJackson was in the army from 2009 to 2012 and worked as an intelligence analyst, the army said. Deployed in Afghanistan in 2010 until 2011, he earned several medals and attained the rank of specialist.\n\nThe military training, Jackson said, helped him plan the bloodshed.\n\n\u201cI had been thinking about it for a long time, for the past couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured I would end up getting shot by police, kill myself, or end up in jail.\u201d\n\nHis attorney, Sam Talkin, has said if the allegations are anywhere close to being true, \u201cthen we\u2019re going to address the obvious psychological issues that are present in this case\u201d.\n\nTopics\n\nNew York\n\nUS crime\n\nRace\n\nHate crime\n\nnews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\nMost viewed\n\nMost viewed"]]
